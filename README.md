## Visual-Skin-Effect-using-Tkinter
### It is about a GUI (using Tkinter) where you can do some calculus and see some approximations.

I developed a code using Tkinter that shows a GUI where you can do some calculus about skin effect and you also have a visual estimation. The red color was used to showing the most concentration about electric current.
